# google_analytics_legacy
Flutter plugin for sending events to Google Analytics (Universal Analytics).

# Setup
To use this plugin, add google_analytics_legacy as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.

## Android
1. Copy your google-service.json to android/app folder
2. Add to your build.gradle
```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

## iOS
After you add this lib to pubspec.yaml you are ready to go.

## Note
I don't own this package. It just a copy and update namespace for use with new version of flutter due to owner not active.
